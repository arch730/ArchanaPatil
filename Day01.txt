Maven
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Netflix	-----> Java (netflix.java)		----> It contains source code of the application

Based on the programming language, we have different build tools
	Java		----> Maven
	Python	----> PyBuilder
	Ruby	----> Rakes
	.net		----> MS Builder

Ant, Gradle...

Developers will write the source code of the application
As a DevOps Engineer, we shall have to deploy the code into the servers
Before deploying the code into the servers, we (DevOps Engineers) need to BUILD the code
To build the code we will use Build tools
For java based projects, we will use Maven as a build tool
Maven is developed by using Java Programming Language
Maven is also known as Java Build Tool
To work with Maven, we need to install Java
Maven is owned by Apache organization

Advantages of using Maven;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
=> Using Maven developers can create the project folder structure

=> Using Maven we can download the "dependencies" which are required to develop the project

What is meant by Dependency?
	Chicken Biryani	-----> Chicken (main ingredient)	-----> rice, masala items,.... (dependencies)
	Netflix			-----> Java	-----> spring boot, spring context (dependencies)

How maven downloads these dependencies?
pom.xml file ---- we will configure the dependencies required for the project
pom.xml file is like an assistant / PA to Maven
pom.xml ----> Project Object Model , Extension Markup Language

java - pom.xml
python - requirements.txt
nodejs - package.json

From where we will get the dependencies?
https://mvnrepository.com/

=> Using maven we can compile the source code of the application
Netflix.java	-----> the .java files cannot executed in the ec2 instance where Java is available
.java files consists of human readable language -----> .java files should converted into machine understandable language (binary - 0s 1s)
To convert human readable language into machine understandable language, we will use MAVEN

								COMPILATION
.java files	 (human readable language)	-------------------------> .class files (machine understandable language)

=> Using Maven we can package multiple .class files
Netflix ----> 100 .java files ----> 100 .class files
When we have multiple .class files, we need to package (bundle) them as a single file - packaging
Using Maven we can package the .class files
These packages are also known as "ARTIFACTS"

Based on the type of application, we will have different packages;
	1. Standalone Applications	-----> .jar (Java Archive)
	2. Web Applications		-----> .war (Web Archive)
	3. Enterprise Applications	-----> .ear (Enterprise Archive)

To execute any java file, we need a machine which is pre-installed with JAVA

What is Build Process?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The process of compilation and packaging is known as build process

Install and Setup of Java & Maven
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/

https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

JAVA_HOME configuration ----> C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21
JAVA PATH configuration ----> C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21\bin
To verify the configuration ----> java --version

MAVEN_HOME configuration ----> C:\apache-maven-3.9.9
MAVEN PATH configuration ----> C:\apache-maven-3.9.9\bin
To verify the configuration ----> mvn --version


Creation of Standalone Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example.app -DartifactId=standalone-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false

mvn archetype:generate → creates a new Maven project from a template (archetype).
-DgroupId=com.example.app → defines your package name (you can change it).
-DartifactId=standalone-app → project folder name.
-DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart → uses the standard Java template (for console/standalone apps).
-DinteractiveMode=false → skips the prompts and directly generates the project.

Creation of Web Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example.webapp -DartifactId=my-webapp -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp -DinteractiveMode=false

Understanding the folder structure;
Whenever we create initial project folder structure, two things will be available;
	1. src folder		- contains source code of the application
	2. pom.xml file	- it is used to configure the dependencies required for the project

Maven Repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have 3 types of maven repos;
	1. Local Repo		- .m2 folder ----> C drive (Find out where)
	2. Central Repo	- mvnrepository.com
	3. Remote Repo	- every organization will maintain their own remote repos to store the artifacts (.jar / .war /.ear file)

Artifact Repo Tools - to store the artifacts in a secure location, we will use Artifact repo tools
Nexus, JFrog, AWS - S3 Buckets

Maven Goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Any maven goal will start with "mvn"
We use goals to compile and package the code
We also use goals to delete the old version .class files and old version artifacts

mvn clean*		- it will delete the existing "target" folder

mvn compile*		- to compile the source code 	- "target" folder gets created	- it contains .class files

mvn test			- to perform the unit test on code

mvn package*		- to package multiple .class files into a single package (artifact)	- inside "target" folder artifacts will be available

mvn install		- to install the entire package as a software

Note: All maven goals should be executed in the path where pom.xml file is available

Understanding the key elements of pom.xml file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SNAPSHOT ----> developers are still developing the code
RELEASE	----> developers has developed the code
